# Coffee logging

Over the course of around 3 months I timed each part of the coffee brewing process. This repo contains the code I used the analyze the data and create [this](https://anthonyyoskovich.com/project/coffee/) post on my website.

- `data/`: contains raw data
- `graphs/`: contains output pngs from analysis 
- `src/`: contains autoexported notebook files in .ipynb and .py formats
- `eda.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `helpers.ipynb`: Contains helpful functions used in `eda.ipynb`
